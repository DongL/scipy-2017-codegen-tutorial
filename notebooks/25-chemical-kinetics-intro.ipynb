    "## Chemical kinetics\n",
    "In chemistry one is often interested in how fast a chemical process proceeds. Chemical reactions (when views as single events on a molecular scale) are probabilitic. However, most reactive systems of interest involve very large number of molecules (a few grams of a simple substance containts on the order of $10^{23}$ molecules. The sheer number allows us to describe this inherently stochastic process deterministically. For example, the following reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 NO + Br_2 \\leftrightarrow 2 NOBr\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which describes the equilibrium between nitrogen monoxide (NO) and bromine ($Br_2$) and nitrosyl bromide (NOBr), can be expressed as a set of two reactions (**f**orward and **b**ackward):\n",

    "\n",
    "the rate of the first process (forward) is proportional to the concentration $Br_2$ and the square of the concentration of NO (consider what happends to the collision frequency when the concentration increases). The rate of the second reaction (the backward process) is in analogy proportional to the square of the concentration of NOBr. Using the proportionality constants $k_f$ and $k_b$ we can formulate our system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as follows:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dc_1}{dt} = 2(k_b c_3^2 - k_f c_2 c_1^2) \\\\\n",

    "\\frac{dc_3}{dt} = 2(k_f c_2 c_1^2 - k_b c_3^2)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Formulating the system of ODEs this way from the basic elementary reactions is in accordancec with the [law of mass action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action), which can be written as follows:\n",
